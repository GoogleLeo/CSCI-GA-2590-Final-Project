", "answer": [36.0], "response": "First, we need to find out how many lawns Edward actually mowed. We can do this by subtracting the number of lawns he forgot to mow (c2) from the total number of lawns he was supposed to mow (c1): \n\nNumber of lawns mowed = c1 - c2 \n\nNext, we can multiply the number of lawns mowed by the amount Edward earned per lawn: \n\nMoney earned = (c1 - c2) x c0 \n\nSo the answer to the question is (c1 - c2) x c0.", "mapping": {"c0": 9.0, "c1": 6.0, "c2": 2.0}}
{"question": " At a restaurant each adult meal costs $c0 and kids eat free. If a group of c1 people came in and c2 were kids, how much would it cost for the group to eat? ", "answer": [14.0], "response": "1. First, we need to determine how many adults are in the group. We can do this by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people: \n\nc1 - c2 = number of adults \n\n2. Next, we can calculate the cost for the adults' meals by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal: \n\n(number of adults) x ($c0 per adult meal) = cost of adult meals \n\n3. Since kids eat for free, we don't need to calculate a cost for their meals. \n\n4. Finally, we can add the cost of the adult meals to get the total cost for the group: \n\ncost of adult meals + cost of kids' meals (which is $0) = total cost \n\nSo the answer is: \n\n(number of adults) x ($c0 per adult meal) = cost of adult meals \n\ncost of adult meals + $0 = total cost \n\nTherefore, the total cost for the group to eat is just the cost of the adult meals, which is: \n\n(number of adults) x ($c0 per adult meal)", "mapping": {"c0": 2.0, "c1": 9.0, "c2": 2.0}}
