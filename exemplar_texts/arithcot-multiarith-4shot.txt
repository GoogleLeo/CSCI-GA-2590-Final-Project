Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the amount of money from Andy and the amount of money from Aaron to calculate the total amount of money they have. Let x be the total amount of money they have,
x = c0 + c1

2. Subtract the money spent by them on video game from the total to calculate how many dollars they have left.
answer = x - c2


Q: Each eraser regardless of brand cost c0. Alice bought c1 erasers from brand A and c2 earsers from brand B. How many dollars did she spend? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the number of erasers from brand A and the number of erasers from brand B to calculate the total number of erasers bought. Let x be the total number of erasers bought,
x = c1 + c2

2. Multiply the number of erasers by the cost of each eraser to calculate how many dollars she spent.
answer = x * c0


Q: A comittee has c0 females and c1 males. If they were split into sub-comittee of size c2 how many sub-comittees could they make? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the number of females and the number of males to calculate the total number of people. Let x be the total number of people,
x = c0 + c1

2. Divide the total number of people by number of people per group to calculate the number of sub comittees.
answer = x / c2


Q: A construction team has already completed c0 meters of a bridge that needs to be c1 meter long. Assuming each meter requries c2 minutes to complete, how many minutes do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Subtract the length of bridge that has been completed from the total length of bridge to calculate the length of remaining bridge. Let x be the length of remaining bridge,
x = c1 - c0

2. Multiply the minutes needed to complete each meter by the meters left to calculate the time remaining.
answer = x * c2
