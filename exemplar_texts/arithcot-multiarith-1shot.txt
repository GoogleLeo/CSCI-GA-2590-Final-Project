Q: Andy and his brother Aaron received money for holiday. Andy had c0 dollars while his brother had c1. If they spent c2 dollars on a new video game, how many dollars do they have left? Write multiple mathematical equations to calculate the answer step by step.

A:
Solve the problem step by step:

1. Add the amount of money from Andy and the amount of money from Aaron to calculate the total amount of money they have. Let x be the total amount of money they have,
x = c0 + c1

2. Subtract the money spent by them on video game from the total to calculate how many dollars they have left.
answer = x - c2
